Stuff to try:
=============

Get Field working with generic types
    can we parametrize it to use R, C, R_n, C_n, G_n?
Use cargo test for testing?
Relations between Field, Vector (space), Multivector, and Matrix?
Can we make it compatible with other Rust numerics?
Function Spaces?
Representations?
